## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned some more cool CSS properties and how they are used on websites. I also adopted Semantic HTML5 Markup which was really helpful and useful. Plus, my approach is mobile first! ðŸ˜Ž

### Continued development

This challenge has quite a tough layout for responsiveness. I hope to refactor and implement new techniques I learn in my development journey.
